# rubasov's dotfiles

These are my random dotfiles for bash, vim and a bunch of other
programs. They are mostly for my own use. However, I like to keep this
repo well factored and commented, so in case you're interested the code
should be quite readable.

The typical environment I use these files in:

* Debian sid
* bash 4.2
* vim 7.3

# A few things that may be worth of your attention

1.  bash prompt with wall-clock-runtime and exit code of last command.

    See `bashrc.d/prompt.sh`.

2.  A 256-color vim colorscheme.

    See `vim/colors/experiment.vim`.

3.  Per screen scrolling in GNU screen by mouse wheel or
    by shift+page{up,down} without messing up the scrollback buffer.

    See `screenrc` and `Xresources`.

# Credits

Almost all the ideas found in these dotfiles came from some hidden corner
of the web during the last decade. I tried to always mention the source
of my inspriation where it is due, but I'm sure I missed a few places. If
you find an omission, let me know and I happily add it.
